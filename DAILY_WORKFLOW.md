## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Never commit `.env` files** - They're now in `.gitignore`, so you're safe!
2. **Your token expires in 90 days** - You'll need to create a new one when it expires
3. **Check your commits on GitHub** - Visit https://github.com/demmarya0000/capstone-template to see your commit history

## 🎯 Pro Tips

- Make small, frequent commits rather than large ones
- Write clear commit messages that explain WHAT you changed and WHY
- Push at least once a day to show consistent progress
- If you get merge conflicts, run `git pull origin main` first, then push
